### GENCO/TRANSCO/DISCOMS

This batch is exclusively for the students of EEE who had passed out of college. We will be concentrating more on objective questions of all the previous papers, backside questions of all the standard textbooks like PS BIMBHRA (PE & Machines), BL THERAJA, AK SAWHNEY, CL WADHWA, etc., Previous IES, some theory and expected models form previous GATE etc., along with clear cut explanation of concepts as this batch won’t be having any time constraint.

This course will help students of TELENGANA/AP achieve their dream of cracking a government job by being by their side and clearing their doubts with the help of personalized TELEGRAM groups.

This initiative by “Edu BASICS” at WARANGAL can act as an alternative to any high-cost coaching institutes that are insensitively rising the fees for coaching to unbearable levels.

So Come join us and “Learn Electrical with Edu Basics”. The coaching here at “Edu Basics” has

- Afforadable fee
- Talented and qualfied faculty (NIT/IIT alumnus)
- Results oriented
- Inclusive growth of a student

This course is also useful to clear AE exams related to any State of India and also useful for other PSUs like TSPSC AEE/CIL/SAIL/ISRO/PGCET etc.
